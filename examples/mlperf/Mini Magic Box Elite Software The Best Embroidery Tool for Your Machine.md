However, according to Embroidery Online[^2^], the manufacturer for mini magic box elite software will no longer supply this product or provide technical support for it.

- Save the contents of your cards to a separate drive, such as a USB device or your computerâs hard drive via your mini magic box elite software while it is still working. This way, you can have a backup of your designs in case your card or converter box stops working.
- Maintain your original design card for proof of ownership and to prevent any copyright issues that could come up in the future.
- Use a different USB port or cable if you get an error from your operating system stating that the converter box cannot be found.
- Clean the slot on the converter box with compressed air if you cannot write to or initialize your card.
