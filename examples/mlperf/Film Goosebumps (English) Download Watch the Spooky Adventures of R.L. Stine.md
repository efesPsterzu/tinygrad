The film Goosebumps (English) is not only a faithful adaptation of R.L. Stine's books, but also a meta-fictional homage to the author and his legacy. The film features Jack Black as Stine, who is portrayed as a reclusive and paranoid writer who keeps his books locked in a secret room. When his new neighbor Zach (Dylan Minnette) accidentally unleashes the monsters from the books, Stine has to team up with Zach, his daughter Hannah (Odeya Rush), and Zach's friend Champ (Ryan Lee) to stop them before they destroy the town.
 
The film is a fun and thrilling adventure that appeals to both fans and newcomers of the Goosebumps series. The film is full of references and Easter eggs to Stine's books, such as the titles, covers, characters, and plots. The film also pays tribute to Stine's influence on the horror genre and pop culture, as well as his humor and creativity. The film is replete with cleverly conceived monsters that derive from classic adult or âadultâ horror, but which are consistently and imaginatively skewed to a younger audienceâs taste and tolerance[^1^]. The point is to supply the requisite, um, goosebumps, but not traumatizing nightmares.
 
The film also benefits from a talented cast that brings charm and energy to their roles. Jack Black is especially entertaining as Stine, who is both eccentric and sympathetic. He delivers some of the funniest lines and moments in the film, as well as some of the most emotional ones. Dylan Minnette, Odeya Rush, and Ryan Lee are also likable and relatable as the teenage protagonists who have to face their fears and save the day. The film also features a cameo by the real R.L. Stine, who plays a teacher named Mr. Black.
