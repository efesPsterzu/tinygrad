If you own a SAAB 9-3 from 2003 to 2006 with the fiber optic MOST network Navigation system, you may be wondering how to update your maps with the latest data. The Navigation system uses SDAL (Shared Data Access Library) format maps from Navteq on a DVD-rom. Unfortunately, SAAB has stopped producing updated discs for this system since 2006, and Navteq does not sell them directly to customers. So what can you do?

One option is to buy a used disc from eBay or other online marketplaces. However, this may not be very reliable, as the disc may be scratched, damaged, or counterfeit. Moreover, you will not get the most recent map data available.
 
Another option is to try to find a compatible disc from another car manufacturer or navigation system that uses SDAL format maps. Some people have reported that the maps for Mazda 6 and Panasonic 2300 DVD systems are identical to the ones for SAAB 9-3[^2^]. However, this is not guaranteed to work, and you may risk damaging your navigation system or voiding your warranty.
 
The best option is to upgrade your navigation system to a newer model that supports more recent map formats and features. You can find various aftermarket solutions online that are compatible with your SAAB 9-3. For example, you can check out [Saab Sat Nav Update Discs | Map DVD 2023](https://www.satnavishop.co.uk/saab-35-c.asp), which offers updated discs for all SAAB models, including the 9-3[^1^]. You can also stream music and podcasts from [SAAB SDAL Navigation DVD Roml](https://soundcloud.com/perikaquicar/saab-sdal-navigation-dvd-roml) by Perikaquicar on SoundCloud[^3^].
 
Updating your SAAB SDAL Navigation system may seem like a hassle, but it is worth it if you want to enjoy the benefits of having accurate and up-to-date maps on your journeys. Whether you choose to buy a used disc, find a compatible one, or upgrade your system, you will be able to navigate with confidence and convenience.
  
## How to Install a New Navigation Disc
 
If you decide to buy a new navigation disc for your SAAB 9-3, you will need to install it properly in your navigation system. The installation process is simple and straightforward, but you should follow these steps carefully to avoid any errors or problems.
 
1. Turn on your ignition and insert the new disc into the DVD slot in the trunk of your car.
2. Wait for the system to recognize the disc and display a message on the screen.
3. Select "Yes" to confirm that you want to update your maps.
4. Wait for the system to copy the data from the disc to the hard drive. This may take several minutes, depending on the size of the disc.
5. When the copying is complete, the system will display a message saying "Update successful".
6. Eject the disc and store it in a safe place.
7. Restart your navigation system and enjoy your updated maps.

## How to Troubleshoot Your Navigation System
 
Sometimes, you may encounter some issues with your navigation system, such as incorrect map data, slow performance, or error messages. Here are some common problems and how to fix them:

- If your map data is outdated or inaccurate, you may need to update your disc with a newer version. You can check the date of your disc by looking at the label or by accessing the system information menu on the screen.
- If your system is slow or freezes, you may need to clear the cache or reset the system. You can do this by pressing and holding the power button for 10 seconds until the system reboots.
- If your system displays an error message such as "Wrong format disc" or "Disc read error", you may have inserted an incompatible or damaged disc. You should check the disc for scratches or dirt and clean it with a soft cloth. You should also make sure that the disc is compatible with your system and that it is an original disc and not a copy.

If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact your SAAB dealer or a qualified technician for further assistance.
