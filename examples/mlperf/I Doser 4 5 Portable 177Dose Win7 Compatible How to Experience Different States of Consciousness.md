According to the official website[^2^], I Doser is used by millions of people worldwide and has been featured in many media outlets.

However, not everyone is convinced by the effectiveness of I Doser. Some users have reported no effects at all, or even negative effects such as headaches, nausea, or anxiety.

Some people may wonder what are the benefits of using I Doser and binaural beats. According to some proponents of binaural beat therapy, listening to these sounds can have various positive effects on the mind and body. Some of the potential benefits include[^1^] [^2^] [^3^] [^4^]:
 
- Reduced stress and anxiety
- Increased focus, concentration, and motivation
- Improved confidence
- Better long term memory
- Deeper meditation
- Enhanced psychomotor performance and mood
- Creativity and relaxation

These benefits are said to be achieved by entraining the brain waves to match the frequency of the binaural beats. Different frequencies of binaural beats are associated with different mental states, such as delta for deep sleep, theta for meditation, alpha for relaxation, beta for focus, and gamma for peak performance.
 
However, not everyone can experience these benefits from binaural beats. Some factors that may affect the effectiveness of binaural beats include:

- The quality of the audio and headphones
- The volume and duration of listening
- The individual's brain structure and sensitivity
- The expectations and beliefs of the listener
- The presence of distractions or background noise

Therefore, it is important to use binaural beats with caution and under proper guidance. Some people may also experience adverse effects from binaural beats, such as headaches, nausea, dizziness, or irritability. If you have any medical conditions or are taking any medications, you should consult your doctor before trying binaural beats.
